# Introduction

## Objective

This project is designed to provide practical experience in building and managing APIs using:
- **FastAPI**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Alembic**
- **Pydantic**

The main focus will be on developing a simple Student Management System: creating models, handling CRUD operations, validating data, and integrating a relational database with a web API.

## Project Timeline

This project spans across 4 weeks:

### Week 1: Introduction & Setup

Set up the development environment and get introduced to FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Alembic, and Pydantic. Review basic Python concepts.

### Week 2: Database Integration & Models

Learn about SQLAlchemy for ORM, create PostgreSQL databases and tables, set up database models in FastAPI, and use Pydantic for data validation.

### Week 3: CRUD Operations

Implement CRUD operations and develop API endpoints for these operations. Validate data using Pydantic models.

### Week 4: Database Migrations & Final Project

Get introduced to Alembic for database migrations, perform database migrations, and finalize the project for presentation.
