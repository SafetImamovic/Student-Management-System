# 5. Simple Frontend

A simple frontend is made just to demonstrate the backend. It is not a full-fledged frontend. It is just a simple HTML page with a form that sends a POST request to the backend. The backend then processes the request and sends a response back to the frontend.

The frontend is made using HTML and CSS and JS. The form in the frontend sends a POST request to the backend. The backend processes the request and sends a response back to the frontend.

A `frontend` directory is created in the project root.

```
student-management-system (root)
└── frontend/
    ├── index.html
    ├── script.js
    └── styles.css
```
