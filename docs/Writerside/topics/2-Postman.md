# 2. Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a popular API client that simplifies the process of testing APIs.
It provides a user-friendly interface for sending requests, inspecting responses,
and organizing API collections. In this project, we will use Postman to test our
FastAPI endpoints and ensure that they work as expected.

> A global variable `{{server}}` is defined as `localhost:8000/api/v0` in the Postman environment.
